# Users API — Usage Guide

This guide describes the users API backed by the local users.json file. It explains the endpoints, required data, and expected behavior so you can build your own requests.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies (run this once from the repository root):

       npm install

2. Start the server:

       npm start

The server runs at <http://localhost:3000>. Keep it running in a separate terminal while you work on your scripts.

## Making requests

Base URL: <http://localhost:3000>

All requests that send a body must use JSON and include the header:

- Content-Type: `application/json; charset=UTF-8`

> [!NOTE]
> In the PATH specifications below, `:id` indicates a path parameter that should be replaced with the actual user ID number.

## Get a single user

- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/users/:id`

Response: a single user object (without `password`) or the text `User not found`.

## List all users

- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/users`

Response: an array of users (without `password`).

## Create a user

- Method: `POST`
- Path: `/users`
- Body: JSON with the following fields:
  - `name` (string)
  - `email` (string)
  - `password` (string, required)
  - `role` (string)
  - `active` (boolean)
  - `department` (string)

Example body:

    {
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
      "password": "secret123",
      "role": "user",
      "active": true,
      "department": "Engineering"
    }

Response: the created user (without `password`) and a generated `id`.

## Update a user (replace all fields)

- Method: `PUT`
- Path: `/users/:id`
- Body: JSON with the full user object (all fields you want to keep must be included).

Example body:

    {
      "name": "Alice Johnson",
      "email": "alice.johnson@example.com",
      "password": "new-secret",
      "role": "admin",
      "active": true,
      "department": "Engineering"
    }

Response: the updated user (without `password`).

## Patch a user (partial update)

- Method: `PATCH`
- Path: `/users/:id`
- Body: JSON with only the fields you want to change.

Example body:

    {
      "email": "alice.updated@example.com"
    }

Response: the updated user (without `password`).

## Delete a user

- Method: `DELETE`
- Path: `/users/:id`

Response: the text "User deleted successfully" on success.

## Notes

- Passwords are never returned in API responses.
- The server hashes the `password` you send in POST, PUT, or PATCH requests.
